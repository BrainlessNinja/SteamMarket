# json_creator.py Documentation

This Python script, `json_creator.py`, is designed to scrape data from a website and save it in a JSON format. It uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests, the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML response, and the `time` library to manage delays.

## Libraries

- `json`: Used for creating and manipulating JSON data.
- `requests`: Used for sending HTTP requests.
- `time`: Used for adding delays with the `sleep` function. This is important to prevent the script from sending too many requests in a short period of time, which could lead to being blocked by the website.
- `BeautifulSoup`: Used for parsing HTML and extracting data. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
- `urllib.parse`: Used for URL parsing and manipulation. This can be used to split, parse, and combine URLs.

## Functions

- `scrape_and_save_prices()`: This function is designed to scrape data from a website and save it in a JSON format. The specific details of what data it scrapes and how it saves it are not provided in the excerpt. However, it likely sends a request to a website, parses the response to extract certain data, and then saves that data in a JSON file.

## Usage

To use this script, you would typically import it in another Python script and call its functions. For example:

```python
import json_creator

json_creator.scrape_and_save_prices()
```

## Dependencies

Before running this script, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install json requests beautifulsoup4 urllib.parse
```

Remember to replace `json_creator` with the actual name of your script if it's different.
